# Project Title : pacmen

# Description of Project
this is a javascript project intended to show scope and code reusability.  the add packman button pushes a pack man to the array.  the code iterates over the array and updates each in tern.  there is also collition detection to keep them from runninf off the sides of the screen. 

# How to Run: 
download all the files, and open the index.html file in a web browser, click "add pack man" as many times as you want, then click "start game", and the pack men will bounce around your screen.

# Roadmap of future improvements: 
to beeter this program I would add a string conctination to make the images cycle and mane the pack men look animated.  I would also use a css class to flip the image if the direction was (-1) or in reverse.
